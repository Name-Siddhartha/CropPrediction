    <p>
      An innovative crop management system that assists the farmers by
      recommending the crops that are suitable for their area according to the
      soil constituents, rainfall, temperature etc. and estimating the crop
      yield in their area, so that crops don't get wasted and are produced
      accordingly.

    <p style="color: #1b5e20">
      Crop and yield prediction are important aspects of an agricultural system.
      The crop and itâ€™s yield primarily depends on weather conditions(rain,
      temperature, etc) and soil parameters(nitrogen, phosphate, potassium,
      etc). Accurate crop and yield prediction requires fundamental
      understanding of the functional relationship between agricultural
      parameters and the interactive weather factors, and to reveal such
      relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful machine
      learning algorithms, which plays an important role in making decisions
      related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #1b5e20">
      Predicting the crop yield in advance of its harvest would help the policy
      makers and farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and
      storage. This project will help the farmers to know the yield of their
      crop before cultivating onto the agricultural field and thus help them to
      make the appropriate decisions. An accurate crop prediction model can help
      farmers to decide on what to grow and when to grow, thus helping the
      farmers to minimize the loss.
